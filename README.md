### Metal & Physical Health

Furthermore, your mental and physical health is also being tarnished if you watch Netflix for more than an hour a day and less than 9 hours a week. Just by sitting on the coach and eating junk food is ruining your overall wellbeing. Just search it up on the internet, search what happens to your health if you continue to binge Netflix. While you’re searching, also search for tips on how to consume Netflix safely, such as eating frozen grapes as snacks compared to nacho cheese chips dipped in nacho cheese sauce.

Your brain on Netflix:

1: You lose the ability to feel awe
2: You are desensitized to violence
3: You no longer enjoy activities you enjoyed before you started watching Netflix
4: You just don’t know what to do with your time? Get back your life.

Netflix claims to be the best thing ever for busy people. They want you hooked on their content, so they incentivize their users. Look at the incentives and see if any of them are unhealthy for your life. Do you use the ‘continue watching’ feature? Do you binge watch?

### Netflix content is not that bad. Just the service and how it makes you addicted to it.

Netflix is an amazing way to spend time with friends and family, but sometimes it can get a little too addicting and render us useless for long hours. That’s where the Netflix Addictector comes in, helping you save countless hours of your life and making sure you stay connected to the people that matter.

It’s easy to get used to Netflix, and addicted to watching all of their shows and movies. But when you spend more time on this online service than watching something else, something is wrong with your brain. One day, you realize Netflix has become more than just a convenient way to watch television. This extension will help you identify and minimize the risks of watching too much Netflix, and start putting your mind into rest when necessary.

Enjoying Netflix & chilling can be unhealthy. Chill on Netflix by taking control of your watching habits. Whether you need to remind yourself of the time, fight your urge to binge with a pause button or reschedule your viewing session, Addictector helps.

Do you spend more time streaming shows than fulfilling responsibilities? Do you binge without even realizing it because of the ultimate Netflix addiction? If so, you’re not alone. They addict thousands of people all over the world to watching too many episodes of their favorite show!

Ever started watching a movie or one episode of a show and suddenly realized that it’s already dark outside... and you have to get up in 6 hours for your job? Well, Netflix Addictector was designed to help you with that.

Don’t Netflix and Chill tonight?
